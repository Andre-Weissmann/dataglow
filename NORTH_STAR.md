# DataGlow North Star

Read this file first, every session, before running a full brainstorm/research ritual again.
If nothing material has changed in the data industry since the last research pass (see date below),
skip straight to "Current concept" and continue building. Only re-trigger deep research if the user
explicitly asks, or on a scheduled cadence.

Last deep research pass: 2026-07-11 (`data_industry_research_2026.md`, 68 inline citations, 12 signals).

## Current concept: AI Readiness Gate

**One sentence:** A dataset, metric, or query result cannot be handed to an AI agent (or exported to a
dashboard/API) until it automatically earns a pass from DataGlow's existing validation — instantly,
invisibly, with zero new approval friction for humans, and a hard stop only for agents.

**Why this concept won round 2 (over Query Memory, the round 1 pick):**
- Directly answers the single most-repeated, highest-magnitude finding in the research: 60-84% of AI
  initiatives fail because ungoverned/unready data is handed to AI before it's fixed, and agents pointed
  at ungoverned data got answers wrong 65%+ of the time (Miro/DataHub case).
- Adds zero governance friction for humans — directly answers the top Reddit complaint ("ten layers of
  approval") by only gating *agents*, never people.
- Reuses 100% of existing infrastructure (20-layer validation suite in `js/validation/validation.js`,
  Metric Contracts in `js/metrics/metric-contracts.js`) — no new validation logic invented, pure
  composition/aggregation on top.
- Prevents the failure before it ships, rather than just documenting it after (Query Memory's weakness).

**How it works:**
1. Pure aggregator over `runAllLayers()` output + Metric Contracts status → single boolean
   `agentConsumable: true/false` + a reasons list citing which layer(s) failed.
2. Humans always see full results and can override; DataGlow's own agent modules (`js/agents/*`) and any
   future MCP-exposed interface are hard-blocked below threshold.
3. When blocked, shows the exact failing layer(s) with a one-click fix path (honest diagnostics, not
   "bad data ruined my AI" hand-waving — a direct wish-list item from the research).

**Build batches (in order, each its own PR):**
1. **Pure scoring/gate module + tests only.** No UI, no agent wiring. (DONE — `js/gate/readiness-gate.js`)
2. **UI badge (pass/fail + reasons) surfaced near query/metric results.** (DONE — `js/gate/readiness-gate-ui.js`,
   wired into the SQL tab; `aiReadinessGateBadge` flag PROMOTED to ON — purely informational, never blocks a human.
   Python/R/Metric Studio wiring + a real per-query metric-contract status remain a follow-up.)
3. **Wire the gate into `js/agents/*` modules as a hard block.** (DONE — `js/gate/agent-gate.js` +
   `generateQuestions`/`resolve` gated behind an optional `readiness` context; `main.js` threads it only when
   the `aiReadinessGateEnforcement` flag is on. Ships DARK: flag default OFF. Blocks ONLY js/agents/* output —
   human-facing SQL/Python/R/Metric Studio workflows are entirely unaffected in both flag states.)
4. (Stretch) Expose the gate via any future MCP interface so external agents respect it too. (NEXT)

## Concept in progress: Polyglot Workbench

**One sentence:** Let an analyst write a query in whatever SQL dialect they already know
(PostgreSQL, MySQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, T-SQL) and have DataGlow transpile it to the
DuckDB SQL its in-browser engine runs — so the tool meets people where they are instead of
forcing everyone to learn one engine's exact syntax first.

**Why it fits DataGlow:** zero-upload / local-first / no-build — the translation is a pure,
dependency-free string rewriter that runs entirely in the browser (no parser service, no
network), mirroring the existing hand-rolled `sql-highlight.js` tokenizer discipline of
never corrupting quoted string literals. It lowers the on-ramp for the large population of
analysts whose muscle memory is a warehouse dialect, without compromising the privacy/offline
guarantees.

**Build batches (in order, each its own PR):**
1. **Batch A — pure dialect adapter + tests, wired into the SQL tab behind a flag.**
   (DONE — `js/app-shell/sql-dialect-adapter.js`: `translateDialectSql(sql, dialect)` +
   `SUPPORTED_DIALECTS`; real per-dialect syntax translation verified against a live DuckDB
   engine in `test/sql-dialect-adapter.test.mjs`. Ships DARK behind `multiDialectSql`
   (default OFF): when on, the SQL tab shows a dialect-picker chip row and transpiles the
   user's SQL before `runQuery`; when off, the SQL tab is byte-for-byte unchanged and the
   default 'duckdb' selection is a no-op passthrough.)
2. **Batch B — Object Space registry.** A shared, cross-runtime view of the named objects
   (tables/frames) live across the SQL/Python/R runtimes. Separate follow-up PR — NOT STARTED
   as of this Batch A PR, and deliberately out of scope here to keep Batch A self-contained.

## Backlog (ranked, queued — not abandoned)

These lost the "combine into one" round but remain valid; pull the next one when Readiness Gate ships.

1. **Query Memory** (round 1 pick) — fingerprint every SQL/Python/R/Metric Studio run, log author +
   timestamp, surface a "seen before" badge grounding trust in validated usage history instead of static
   docs (DataHub's finding). Complementary to the Gate — could become the audit trail *behind* the
   Gate's decisions in a later phase.
2. Machine-readable Metric Contracts extended with agent-access rules (who/what is authorized to query
   a given metric) — partially exists, could be deepened.
3. Git-for-data version control (branch/commit/diff/rollback for datasets) — not present in DataGlow.
4. Agent audit-trail standard (IETF draft) — structured, SOC2/EU-AI-Act-ready logging of agent actions.
5. Cross-org clean-room-style privacy-preserving joins, generalized beyond the federated-learning module
   already in `js/federated/`.
6. Healthcare interoperability (FHIR/OMOP/TEFCA) used explicitly as a cross-org trust *protocol*
   template, not just a domain pack.
7. Governance-as-living-layer: one queryable interface for humans and agents (Gartner's "context as
   infrastructure" framing) — partially achieved once the Gate ships.

## Polyglot Workbench (parallel track)

A separate exploratory track (not from the ranked backlog above) making SQL/Python/R feel like one
workbench instead of three siloed runtimes. Shipped as small additive batches, each its own PR:
- **Batch A — Multi-dialect SQL adapter** (`js/app-shell/sql-dialect-adapter.js`, flag `multiDialectSql`):
  separate PR, owned by another track. Not a dependency of Batch B.
- **Batch B — Object Space registry** (`js/app-shell/object-space.js`, flag `objectSpaceRegistry`,
  default OFF): in-PR. A passive, in-memory single source of truth for named cross-language objects
  (name, originLanguage, kind, schema, rowCount, provenance pointer). Sits ALONGSIDE the existing
  per-language JSON bridges — does NOT replace transfer mechanics and does NOT do query-time
  cross-language resolution (`FROM py.name` is a deliberate future batch). Read-only UI strip in the
  data sidebar. Ships dark; zero behavior change when the flag is off.

## Lessons learned

- **Flip (or explicitly flag as still-dark) the visibility flag before reporting a batch done.** Batch 2
  shipped the readiness badge behind `aiReadinessGateBadge` default-OFF and was reported "done" while the
  feature was actually invisible to every user. "Landed dark" is not the same as "shipped/visible" — when a
  batch is meant to be seen, promote its flag (and update the flag-state guard test) in the SAME or the very
  next PR, and when it is meant to stay dark, say so explicitly in the done report. (Fixed for the badge in
  `sync-northstar-badge-and-batch3`: badge flag promoted to ON; batch-3 enforcement intentionally stays OFF
  and is reported as such.)

## Efficiency note for future sessions

The user has explicitly said repeating the full ritual "round after round" without shipping/testing
anything is unproductive. Default behavior going forward:
- Read this file first.
- If the user says "brainstorm" / "what's next" without new context, propose the next backlog item
  or a genuine improvement to it — do not restart from zero research.
- Only run a full new deep-research pass if the user explicitly asks, or it's been a long time
  (e.g. 1+ months) since the last pass.

## Standing brainstorm process (permanent — do not ask the user to re-paste the ritual)

As of 2026-07-11, the user confirmed this 10-step process is the permanent default for ANY
"brainstorm ideas for X in DataGlow" request, whether X is a whole infrastructure area or a single
small widget. The user should never need to re-type the long "think creatively / revolutionary /
sci-fi / tear down walls" ritual again — that mindset is now permanently baked into steps 3-5 below,
applied automatically every time, at whatever scale the request calls for:

1. Read this file (`NORTH_STAR.md`) — what's shipped, mid-flight, and already ranked in the backlog.
2. Read the actual relevant code for the area in question — ground ideas in what's real, not assumed.
3. Research only if genuinely new ground (not a repeat of a prior pass). When researching, or even
   when just reasoning from existing knowledge, permanently apply this lens: think revolutionary,
   flip the script, think privacy/safety/governance, tear down walls between roles/tools/orgs,
   think sci-fi-but-buildable, think like no one else in the industry is thinking, think ROI and
   real business value, think about what people wish already existed.
4. Brainstorm candidate ideas through that same lens — bold, inventive, solving a real problem.
5. Rank them honestly by real value, buildability, and fit with DataGlow's existing philosophy.
6. Combine the strongest ideas into ONE concept — never present a menu.
7. Check the concept against existing capabilities/modules for duplication.
8. Present the one concept with reasoning.
8b. **Live desktop + mobile preview (mandatory, added 2026-07-11):** build a visual mockup of the
    concept rendered inside DataGlow's actual UI shell (reuse real CSS/theme/layout, not a generic
    wireframe), deploy it to a live link at BOTH a desktop viewport and a mobile viewport, and share
    both links so the user can see how it actually looks before deciding anything. Never substitute
    a written description for this step. This is a look-and-feel mockup only, built as a standalone
    deployed copy — never touch the production repo/main branch just to produce a preview.
9. After the live preview is shown, end with ONE concrete build-order fork (2 options max) — not an
   open-ended question.
10. Build it as a small, tested, isolated batch — real PR, real CI, ship dark behind a flag if it
    changes visible/human-facing behavior.
11. Report the real, concrete result once merged/tested — update this file's backlog and "current
    concept" section so nothing is lost and the next round starts from here, not from zero.

Do not ask the user whether to apply "the creative lens" — always apply it. Do not ask the user to
confirm this process again in future sessions unless they explicitly want to change it. Do not skip
the live desktop + mobile preview step (8b) — it was explicitly requested by the user on 2026-07-11
so they can actually see, not just read about, how a brainstormed idea would look in DataGlow.
